Phase 2 - Networking
Day 12: IP Addresses

An IP address is a number that identifies a machine on a network.

Key ideas:
- Machines need addresses to send messages
- IPv4 addresses look like four numbers separated by dots
- Private IPs are used inside networks only
- Public IPs are used to communicate over the internet
- One machine can have multiple IP addresses

IP addresses identify machines, not users or permissions.
