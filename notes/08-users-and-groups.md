Linux Users and Groups - Day 8

Linux controls access using users and groups.

Key ideas:
- Every file has a user owner and a group owner
- Permissions apply separately to user, group, and others
- Groups represent roles, not individuals

Commands used:
- whoami        : show current user
- groups        : show group memberships
- chgrp         : change group ownership of a file

Changing a file’s group changes who the group permissions apply to.

This model is the foundation of role-based access control used later in cloud IAM systems.
