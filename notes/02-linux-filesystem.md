Linux Filesystem & Navigation - Day 2

What Linux is:
Linux is an operating system designed to run servers and infrastructure.
It gives direct control over files, processes, and permissions.

The filesystem:
Linux uses a single filesystem tree starting at / (root).
Everything on the system exists somewhere under this tree.

Key locations:
- /        : the root of the entire system
- /home    : where user files live
- ~        : shortcut for my home directory

Navigation commands:
- pwd      : shows where I currently am
- ls       : lists what is in the current directory
- cd       : moves into another directory
- cd ..    : moves up one directory
- cd ~     : returns to my home directory

Notes:
Navigation is about knowing where you are before doing anything else.
This prevents mistakes and is critical on servers and cloud systems.
