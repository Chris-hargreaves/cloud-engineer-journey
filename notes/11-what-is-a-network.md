Phase 2 - Networking
Day 11: What a Network Is

A network is a connection of machines that can communicate with each other if allowed.

Key ideas:
- Networks define boundaries
- Machines inside a network can talk more easily
- Machines outside are restricted
- Rules decide what communication is permitted

Networking is fundamentally about permission and control, not cables or hardware.
