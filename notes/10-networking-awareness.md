Linux Networking Awareness - Day 10

Today introduced the basic idea of networking in Linux.

Key concepts:
- Computers have IP addresses
- Services listen on ports
- A service must be running and listening to accept connections

Important ideas:
- localhost (127.0.0.1) means the machine talking to itself
- Private IP addresses are not reachable from the internet
- Ports identify specific services

Observed example:
- A service listening on TCP port 53 on a private IP
- This indicates a DNS-related service running internally

Networking is about services, addresses, and ports working together.
