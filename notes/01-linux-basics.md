Linux Basics - Day 1

Commands I used today:
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- mkdir
- nano
- git clone

What each command does (in my own words):
- pwd:
- ls:
- cd:
- mkdir:
- nano:
- git clone:

Notes:
- WSL Ubuntu is now installed and connected to GitHub via SSH.
What each command does (in my own words):
- pwd: shows me the current folder I am in
- ls: lists the files and folders in the current location
- cd: moves me into a different folder
- mkdir: creates a new folder
- nano: opens a text editor in the terminal
- git clone: copies a project from GitHub onto my laptop
