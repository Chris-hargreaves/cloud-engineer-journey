Linux Permissions - Day 3

Linux controls access using permissions.
Every file and directory has:
- An owner
- A group
- Others

Each can have permission to:
- Read (r)
- Write (w)
- Execute (x)

Permissions are enforced by the operating system, not by applications.

Removing write permission prevents changes even by the owner.
Restoring permission allows changes again.

This same model appears later in cloud security and IAM.
