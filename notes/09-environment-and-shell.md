Linux Environment and Shell - Day 9

The shell is a program that runs commands and provides context.

Environment variables are named values passed to programs.

Key ideas:
- Environment variables configure program behaviour
- They avoid hard-coded values
- They can be temporary or permanent

Important variables:
- USER   : current user
- HOME   : home directory
- SHELL  : active shell program
- PATH   : directories searched for commands

Commands used:
- printenv
- echo $VAR
- export VAR=value
- unset VAR

Environment variables are widely used in cloud systems for configuration and secrets.
